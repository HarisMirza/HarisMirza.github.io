    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>What does the future hold for us? Will computers ever be smarter than a human? In the past 20 years, technology has boomed to an unimaginable level and keeps increasing every year. We are at the point where are cars can drive themselves and electrically powered. Computers have billions of transistors and react within nanoseconds. Phones are super fast supercomputers that can easily fit in your pocket and have wireless charging and imaculet photography features. In other technology news, you can receive anything you want through Amazon, healthcare right at your home, and much much more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>These days, computers are the pinnacle of all things in society and are used everyday in everyway throughout the whole world. These computers have the ability now to do anything you think of whether you want to create a website, order something from the store, and anything else. The main computer companies these days are Apple and Microsoft and they have ceased the market. Now it  is a race of who can make the fastest computer with the most storage and data at the least price. They also take into consideration the consumer perspective and try adding all the new latest features they possibly can in that one computer. Many people buy these computers more for the reason that they can say they have one but rarely utilize it. With Intel, Qualcomm, AMD, and more companies supplying the major computer retailers with their chips and other computer based accessories. </p>
    <br>
    <p>There is also another major industry and one of the industries that is undergoing the most change is the car industry. With the thought of a car driving itself was mere fantasy but now it becoming reality with car companies such as Tesla and even traditional car companies like Mercedes. Most cars these days have self-park assist, motion sensors to detect any nearby cars or pedestrians. The real problem with cars that have all these features is that they can be real expensive especially with the type of market being so inflated. Companies like Tesla is causing a disruption in the current car industry with their full electric, self-driving, and features such as doors opening by themselves with a click of a button. </p>
    <p>The last major technology related industry is the phone industry which is almost like a necessity these days. With Apple, Samsung, and Google basically always competing to be the best phone company in the world, they each have created supercomputers right at your fingertips. There is a very controvesial debate over which phone company is more reliable, more battery, cheaper, more consumer friendly, better camera, better sound system, and more. Especially with their newest phones the Iphone X, Galaxy S8, and the Google Pixel 2 respectively, they have built the basis for millions of users and while Apple is statistically the most popular, the other two companies are giving them a run for their money. </p>
